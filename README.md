## 🧑‍💻 Contributor Guidelines

Please follow these steps carefully while adding your project to ensure everything works smoothly:

### ✅ 1. Add Your Project to `projects` Array in `index.js`

- Open the `index.js` file.
- Locate the `projects` array.
- Add your project title **at the end** of the array in quotes, followed by a comma.

```js
const projects = [
  "To-Do List",
  "Weather App",
  "Your New Project", // 👈 Add your title like this
  "BrainBuzz Quizz Website"
];
```


🔥 Make sure each item is comma-separated. Missing a comma will break the table!

 ### 📅 2. Match the Day Number
The Day number is auto-generated based on the order of the project in the array.

So if your project is 6th in the array, it's considered Day 06.


📁 3. Add Project Files in the Correct Folder
Go to the public folder.

Create a new folder as: dayXX (replace XX with your Day number).

Place all your project files inside it.

``` pgsql
Copy
Edit
public/
  └── day06/
        ├── index.html
        ├── style.css
        └── script.js
```

🔗 4. Demo Link
The live demo link is auto-generated as:
```
bash
Copy
Edit
public/dayXX/index.html
```
So make sure your index.html is correctly placed in that folder.


⚠️ 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Missing commas in the projects array

❌ Skipping day numbers or placing projects out of order

❌ Incorrect folder names (like Day6 instead of day06)

❌ Not placing an index.html file inside your folder
